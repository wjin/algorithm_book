##  Median of Two Sorted Arrays (lc)

**Description**

There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity
should be O(log (m+n)).

**Analysis**

See [median](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) definition at wikipedia.

Generally, this problem can be classified to 'find the Kth number of two sorted arrays'.

According to the description 'sorted array' and 'log' time complexity,
we cannot merge two arrays to get the median as time complexity is O(m+n).

Actually, if each time we can decrease k to k/2, and search (k/2)th in two sorted arrays,
we can get *log* time complexity.

We can compare A[k/2] with B[k/2] and then divide it into three sub cases and only need to search
k/2 in one of three cases.

1. A[k/2] == B[k/2]
2. A[k/2] < B[k/2]
3. A[k/2] > B[k/2]

**Code**

```cpp
// O(log(m+n)), O(1)
class Solution
{
public:
    // a[] has m numbers from 0...m-1
    // b[] has n numbers from 0...n-1
    double findKth(int a[], int m, int b[], int n, int k)
    {
        if (m > n) // keep m is little than or equal to n
            return findKth(b, n, a, m, k);

        // simple case to get the kth number
        if (m == 0)
            return b[k - 1];
        if (k == 1)
            return min(a[0], b[0]);

        // partition k numbers to two arrays
        // the small array has at most k/2 numbers
		// pb >= pa
        int pa = min(k / 2, m);
        int pb = k - pa;

        if (a[pa - 1] < b[pb - 1]) {
            // kth number is located in either a[pa...m-1] or b[0...pb-1]
			return findKth(a + pa, m - pa, b, pb, k - pa);
        } else if (a[pa - 1] > b[pb - 1]) {
            // kth number is located in either a[0...pa-1] or b[pb...n-1]
			return findKth(a, pa, b + pb, n - pb, k - pb);
        } else {
            return a[pa - 1];
        }
    }

    double findMedianSortedArrays(int A[], int m, int B[], int n)
    {
        if (m == 0 && n == 0) { // invalid
            return -1;
        }

        long long total = m + n; // m + n may overflow
        if ((total & 0x1) == 1) { // odd
            return findKth(A, m, B, n, total / 2 + 1);
        } else { // even, get middle two numbers and calculate average
            return (findKth(A, m, B, n, total / 2)
                    + findKth(A, m, B, n, total / 2 + 1)) / 2;
        }
    }
};
